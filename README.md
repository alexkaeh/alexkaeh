### Hi there 👋

I'm a graduate of Merit America's Java Development BootCamp.

I'm psyched to be taking the next steps to pursue my longtime love of programming and open-source development!

- 🏫 I’m currently working on Harvard CS50 and my AWS certification
- 🍾 I’m currently getting some Coke Zero, that's my fuel
- 💪 I’m looking to contribute to open-source projects, especially using Javascript, React, or Java
- 🙏 I’m looking for entry-level software developer jobs!
- 🤖 Ask me about open-source, interop, or AI safety
- 📫 How to reach me: @PlausibleOrange on Twitter or alexkaehler1@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- 👞 Fun fact: I can tie my shoes faster than anyone I know
